<p>
    This is a very simplistic tool for converting hand-written notes (e.g., on a <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable</a>)
    to <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcards. It works by detecting lines surrounding flashcards as in the
    example below and crops the image appropriately. At the moment this is extremely simplistic and all configuration options are
    hidden in the code, but I plan on expanding (and prettifying) this tool in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Usage: Just drop an image file below and the flashcards will be generated, triggering a download of an Anki package.
